            <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>I was not allowed to publish the two cases i had developed, but those softwares are built in XCode using the Interface Builder and the commom process of development. One of those have multiple versions, for iOS (iPhone and iPad), and for just Android cellphones (multiple resolutions), the other was just for iPad with rotation trick. No big deals on the way, the challange here were adaptative screens for iOS, and the first experience in iOS, what i can say that was a pleasure. XCode and Objective-C are well documented and the internet is fulled with samples and tutorials.</p>
