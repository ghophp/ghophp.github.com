            <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>The main goal was to develop a cross-platform (Windows and MAC) catalog and a AutoCAD plugin. Using C++ and Qt to emulate the Webkit, me and an extraordinary team came up with a powerful layer to communicate and incorporate HTML and Javascript templates with C++.</p>
            <p>We didn't had time to develop the layouts made by designers, because we already had a lot of implementations to do over the core, but we had a few web developers at disposal, so we integrated webkit core and wrote a few interfaces to communicate C++ and Javascript easily. At the end, not just the product was really good, but the core still has and enormous potential by himself to make the desktop cross-platform development more easy.</p>
            <p>This contributed a lot for my expertise in cross-platform C++ and low level deployment.</p>
