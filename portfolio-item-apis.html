            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This software was built by me and a partner. His main goal is to track timber haul in a Ontario's forest, was involves a lot of business logic and data.</p>
            <p>Zend and MySQL always do a great partnership, in this case wasn't different. In a hand you have ZF2, a little slow, but very robust and stable, and in another hand, you have MySQL, a fast database.</p>
            <p>I gained a lot of expirience with the project, mainly, working with international teams, and a client not used to computers. The efforts are rewarding, once you see the impact of this software as a contribuition to the enviroment.</p>
