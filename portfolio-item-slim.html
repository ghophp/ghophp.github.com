            <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>This one was a really big challenge, the deadline was short and the layout had a series of resize functionalities. I started the project using Bootstrap CSS, Slim Framework and Twig Template Engine, and did a fast development.</p>
            <p>This is one of the project that compose my deep social network integration experience, I have a lot of other projects like this, that are short marketing campaigns, that require some kind of integration and data extraction from social networks.</p>
            <p>The result was excellent, a lot of persons participated the campaign, sharing their dreams to a human resource department.</p>
