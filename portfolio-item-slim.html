            <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>I am not allowed to publish the case here, but this was a really big challange, the deadline was short and the layout required a series of resize functionalities. I started the project using Bootstrap CSS, Slim Framework and Twig Template Engine, and get a pretty fast development. This is one of the project that compose my social network integration experience, i have a lot of other projects, that are short marketing campains, that require some kind of integration and data extraction from social networks.</p>
